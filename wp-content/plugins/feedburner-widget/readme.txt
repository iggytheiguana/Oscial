Sidebar widget to easy customize and display your FeedBurner RSS subscribers stats button. All settings are available from Sidebar Widget Admin.




== Description ==

FeedBurner Widget is very simple sidebar widget plugin to easy customize and display your FeedBurner subscribers stats button.

To use it, you have to register by [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com/ "Register by FeedBurner") first, to add your feed and to **activate the Feed Count service** for it. All of the FeedBurner chicklet customization options are available to edit from the menu: WP-Admin: Appearance: Widgets.

The widget is updated to work with the new FeedBurner URIs (feeds2.feedburner.com) after the Google changes. You can see the demo of the plugin in action on [Balkans 360](http://balkans360.com/ "Balkans Infoportal") website in the right sidebar.

This widget was written for a customer of [ABA Web Design Studio](http://aba.bg/ "ABA Web Design Studio") and is listed here with their knowledge. Please [contact me](http://dichev.com/contact/english/ "Contact information") if you find any bug in this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this an official FeedBurner plugin? =

No, it is not. I have written this plugin for a customer of my company [ABA Web Design](http://aba.bg/ "Web Design Studio of ABA Ltd"). It was listed here, because I find it useful and I will be very happy if the FeedBurner users like it too.

= Does FeedBurner Widget support the new feeds2.feedburner.com URLs? =

Yes, it does. The widget was updated to use the new URIs after the Google changes.

= My FeedBurner account is configured to work with my own domain, using the MyBrand service? Is it possible to use the widget with MyBrand instead of the FeedBurner URL? =

Yes, it is. FeedBurner Widget has now support for MyBrand. So, you can configure it very easy and use it with your own domain URL. (Thanks to [mohanjith](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/mohanjith "Sudirikku Mohanjith") for the idea.)
